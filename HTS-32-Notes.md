(ij) Plain weave

A fabric construction in which each yarn of the weft passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the warp and each yarn of the warp passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the weft.

The definitions at (d) to (h) above apply, _mutatis mutandis_, to knitted or crocheted fabrics.

2.
(A) Products of chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly of that textile material which would be selected under note 2 to this section for the classification of a product of chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 5809 consisting of the same textile materials.

(B) For the application of this rule:

(a) Where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under general interpretative rule 3 shall be taken into account;
(b) In the case of textile products consisting of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface no account shall be taken of the ground fabric;

### Additional U.S. Notes

1. In the case of each provision in the tariff schedule on which the United States has agreed to reduce the rate of duty, pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under section 101 of the Trade Act of 1974 before January 3, 1980, on any cotton, wool or man-made fiber textile product as defined in the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles, as extended on December 14, 1977 (the Arrangement), if the Arrangement, or a substitute arrangement, including unilateral import restrictions or bilateral agreements, determined by the President to be suitable, ceases to be in effect with respect to the United States before the total reduction in the rate of duty for such provision under sections 101 and 109 of the Trade Act of 1974 has become effective, then the President shall proclaim the rate of duty in rate column 1 for such provision existing on January 1, 1975, to be the rate of duty effective, with respect to articles entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, within 30 days after such cessation and until the President proclaims the continuation of such reduction under the next sentence. If subsequently the Arrangement or a substitute arrangement, including unilateral import restrictions or bilateral agreements, determined by the President to be suitable, is in effect with respect to the United States, then the President shall proclaim the continuation of the reduction of such rate of duty pursuant to such trade agreement. For purposes of section 109(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, any time when a rate of duty existing on January 1, 1975, is in effect under this note shall be time when part of such reduction is not in effect by reason of legislation of the United States or action thereunder.

2. The term "Certified hand-loomed and folklore" as used with respect to products provided for in the tariff schedule, refers to such products as have been certified, in accordance with procedures established by the United States Trade Representative pursuant to international understandings, by an official of a government agency of the country where the products were produced, to have been so made.

### Statistical Notes

1. Restraints under the Arrangement regarding International Trade in Textiles may not apply to developing country exports of "hand-loomed and folklore products" which have been certified, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements pursuant to international understandings, by an official of a government agency of the country where the products were produced, to have been so made. The importer is required to identify such certified products on the entry summary or withdrawal forms by placing the symbol "F" as a prefix to the appropriate 10-digit statistical reporting number.
2. For the purposes of the Tariff Schedule:

   (a) The term "subject to cotton restraints" means articles in which:
   (i) The cotton component equals or exceeds 50 percent by weight of all the component fibers thereof; or
   (ii) The cotton and any wool, fine animal hair or man-made fibers in the aggregate equals or exceeds 50 percent by weight of all the component fibers thereof and the cotton component equals or exceeds the weight of each of the wool (including fine animal hair) and man-made fiber components.

   (b) The term "subject to wool restraints" means articles not provided for in (a) above and in which the wool (including fine animal hair) component exceeds 17 percent by weight of all the component fibers thereof.

(c) The term "subject to man-made fiber restraints" means articles not provided for in (a) or (b) above and the man-made fiber component, or the man-made fibers and any cotton, wool or fine animal hair in the aggregate, equals or exceeds 50 percent by weight of all the component fibers thereof.

For the application of this note, where appropriate, only the part of the product which determines the classification under general interpretive rule 3 shall be taken into account.

3. As a convenient cross-reference, each of the textile categories (or groupings) used by the United States in monitoring shipments of these products and to administer the United States textile trade agreements programs is listed in the schedule following the appropriate 10-digit description.

## CHAPTER 52

#### COTTON

### Subheading Note

1. For the purposes of subheadings 5209.42 and 5211.42, the expression "**denim**" means fabrics of yarns of different colors, of 3-thread or 4-thread twill, including broken twill, warp faced, the warp yarns of which are of one and the same color and the weft yarns of which are unbleached, bleached, dyed grey or colored a lighter shade of the color of the warp yarns.

### Additional U.S. Notes

1. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the staple length of cotton shall be determined for all customs purposes by application of the Official Cotton Standards of the United States for length of staple, as established by the Secretary of Agriculture and in effect when the determination is to be made.
2. For the purposes of classifying yarns of headings 5205 and 5206 the term "**nm**," as applied in these headings, means the number of 1,000-meter lengths of yarn in one kilogram. To determine the nm measurement of any yarn, whether single, multiple (folded) or cabled, the actual meters per kilogram shall be divided by 1,000 and the quotient thereof multiplied by the number of single yarns therein, including the single yarns used in manufacturing multiple (folded) or cabled yarns.
3. For the purposes of the woven fabrics of chapter 52:
   (a) The term "**number**," as applied to woven fabrics of cotton, means the average yarn number of the yarns contained therein. In computing the average yarn number, the length of the yarn is considered to be equal to the distance covered by it in the fabric in the condition as imported, with all clipped yarn being measured as if continuous and with the count being taken of the total single yarns in the fabric including the single yarns in any multiple (folded) or cabled yarns. The weight shall be taken after any excessive sizing is removed by boiling or other suitable process. Any one of the following formulas can be used to determine the average yarn number for tariff purposes--

$$
N = \text{BYT}/1,000, 100T/Z', \text{BT}/Z \text{ or } \text{ST}/10


$$

when:

N is the average yarn number,
B is the breadth (width) of the fabric in centimeters,
Y is the meters (linear) of the fabric per kilogram,
T is the total single yarns per square centimeter,
S is the square meters of fabric per kilogram,
Z is the grams per linear meter of fabric, and
Z' is the grams per square meter of fabric.

Fractions in the resulting "**number**" shall be disregarded.

(b) Unless the context otherwise requires, provisions relating to one or more weaves embrace only those fabrics which (excluding selvage) are wholly of the specified weave or weaves, including combinations exclusively thereof.

4. For the purposes of heading 5208 and 5209, the term "**certified hand-loomed fabrics**" means fabrics made on a hand loom (i.e., a nonpower-driven loom) by a cottage industry and which prior to exportation have been certified by an official of a government agency of the country where the fabrics were produced to have been so made.

5. The aggregate quantity of cotton, not carded or combed, the product of any country or area including the United States, having a staple length under 28.575 mm (1-1/8 inches) (except harsh or rough cotton, having a staple length under 19.05 mm (3/4 inch)), entered under subheading 5201.00.14 during the 12-month period from September 20 in any year through September 19, inclusive, shall not exceed 20,207.05 metric tons (articles the product of Mexico shall not be permitted or included in the aforementioned quantitative limitation and no such articles shall be classifiable therein).

Of the quantitative limitations provided for in this note, the countries listed below shall have access to not less than the quantities specified below:

### Statistical Note

1. Provisions for semiconductor manufacturing and testing machines and apparatus cover products for the growth and processing of semiconductor materials, such as silicon and gallium arsenide, the processing of such materials into semiconductor devices and the testing of such devices (in general the testing equipment, as well as some of the processing equipment, is classified in chapter 90). More specifically the goods include the following:

(a) Wafer manufacturing equipment:

(i) Crystal growers & pullers - used to produce extremely pure monocrystalline semiconductor boules from which wafers can be sliced. Most common methods employed in these crystal growers and pullers are the Czochralski and float zone methods.

(ii) Wafer preparation equipment:

(A) Crystal grinders - used to grind the crystal boule to precise diameter required for wafers and to grind the flats on the boule to indicate the conductivity type and resistivity of the crystal.

(B) Wafer slicing saws - used to slice wafers from a boule of monocrystalline semiconductor material.

(C) Wafer grinders, lappers and polishers - used to prepare the semiconductor wafer for the fabrication process. This involves bringing the wafer within dimensional tolerances. Especially critical is the flatness of its surface.

(b) Mask fabrication and repair equipment:

(i) Fabrication equipment - used to transfer design patterns to a mask or reticle, this equipment generally utilizes optical, electron beam or X-rays to write circuit patterns on photoresist coated substrates. After development, these substrates become the mask or reticle for wafer fabrication.

(ii) Repair equipment - this equipment generally utilizes focused ion beams or laser beams. They are used directly on the mask or reticle to remove chrome.

(c) Wafer fabrication equipment:

(i) Film formation equipment - used to apply or produce various films on the surface of the wafer during the fabrication process. These films serve as conductors, insulators and semiconductors on the finished device. They may include oxides and nitrides of the substrate surface, metals, and epitaxial layers. The processes and equipments listed below are not necessarily limited to the generation of a particular type of film.

(A) Oxidation furnaces - used to form a "film" of oxide on the wafer. The oxide is formed by the chemical reaction of the top molecular layers of the wafer with the applied oxygen or steam under heat.

(B) Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) equipment - used to deposit various types of films which are obtained by combining the appropriate gases in a reactant chamber at elevated temperatures. This constitutes a thermochemical vapor-phase reaction. Operations may take place at atmospheric or low pressure (LPCVD) and may use plasma enhancement (PECVD).

(C) Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) equipment - used to deposit various types of films which are obtained by vaporizing a solid.

(1) Evaporation equipment - in which the film is generated by heating the source material.

(2) Sputtering equipment - in which the film is generated by bombarding the source material (target) with ions.

(D) Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) equipment - used to grow epitaxial layers on a heated monocrystalline substrate in an ultrahigh vacuum using beams of molecules. The process is similar to PVD.

(ii) Doping equipment - which is used to introduce dopants into the wafer surface in order to modify the conductivity or other characteristics of a semiconductor layer:

(A) Thermal diffusion equipment - in which the dopants are introduced into the surface of the wafer by the application of gases under high temperatures.

(B) Ion Implantation - in which the dopants are "driven" into the crystal lattice structure of the surface of the wafer in the form of a beam of accelerated ions.

(C) Annealing furnaces - which are used to repair the crystal lattice structures of the wafer damaged by ion implantation.

(iii) Etching and stripping equipment - used for etching or cleaning surfaces of the wafers.

(A) Wet etching equipment - in which chemical etching materials are applied by spraying or immersion. Spray etchers provide more uniform results than bath etchers, since they perform the operation on one wafer at a time.

(B) Dry plasma etching - in which etching materials are presented as gases within a plasma energy field, providing an anisotropic etch profile.

(C) Ion beam milling equipment - in which ionized gas atoms are accelerated toward the wafer surface. The impact results in the top layer being physically removed from the surface.

(D) Strippers or ashers - using techniques similar to etching, this apparatus removes the spent photoresist from the surface of the wafer after it has served its purpose as a "stencil". This equipment is also used for removal of nitrides, oxides, and polysilicon, with an isotropic etch profile.

(iv) Lithography equipment - used to transfer the circuit designs to the photoresist coated surface of the semiconductor wafer.

(A) Equipment for coating wafers with photoresist - these include the photoresist spinners which are used to apply liquid photoresist evenly over the surface of the wafer.

(B) Equipment for exposing the photoresist coated wafer with the circuit design (or a part thereof):

(1) Using a mask or reticle and exposing the photoresist to light (generally ultraviolet) or, in some instances, X-rays:

(a) Contact printers - where the mask or reticle is in contact with the wafer during exposure.

(b) Proximity aligners - similar to contact aligners except actual contact does not take place between the mask or reticle and the wafer.

(c) Scanning aligners - which use projection techniques to expose a continuously moving slit across the mask and wafer.

(d) Step and repeat aligners - which use projection techniques to expose the wafer a portion at a time. Exposure can be by reduction from the mask to the wafer or 1:1. Enhancements include the use of an excimer laser.

(2) Direct write on wafer equipment - these apparatus operate with no mask or reticle. They use a computer controlled "writing beam" (such as an electron beam (E-beam), ion beam or laser) to "draw" the circuit design directly on the photoresist coated wafer.

(C) Equipment for developing exposed wafers - these include chemical baths similar to those used in photographic laboratory applications.

(d) Assembly equipment:

(i) Dicing equipment - these include sawing machines and scribbling machines (including laser scribers) and dicing accessories such as wafer breaking equipment.

(ii) Die bonding equipment - which installs the die to the package by soldering or gluing

(iii) Wire bonding equipment - used for attaching thin wires or tapes (usually of gold, aluminum or copper) from the die bonding pads to the corresponding pads on the package.

(iv) Packaging equipment - which are used to encapsulate or package a semiconductor device. They include sealing furnaces, lid welders, plastic encapsulation presses, lead trim and form equipment, package deflashers, and tin dip and solder plate equipment.

(e) Testing and inspection equipment:

(i) Optical inspection equipment - These include equipment that "examines" portions of the wafer surface and compares them either to a standard pattern or to other portions of the wafer surface.

(ii) Electrical testing equipment - These include computer controlled systems that test the functions and electrical specifications of semiconductor devices through the application and detection of electrical signals or patterns. Testing is performed on both unencapsulated dice and packaged integrated circuits.

### Statistical Notes

1. The calculation of duties on various watches, clocks, watch movements and clock movements requires that these articles be constructively separated into their component parts and each component separately valued. The individual components shall be separately reported under the statistical suffixes show below. In each instance the sum of the values of the individual components shall be equal to the total value of the article. In those instances where the components of an article are to be separately reported under the following reporting scheme, the entry should include all the individually named components even if not included in the shipment. In such instance the entered quantity and value would be zero. For example, entry of a battery powered watch, imported without a battery, classifiable under subheading 9101.11.40 would include a line for the statistical reporting number for the battery (9101.11.4040) with the quantity and value shown as zero. To determine the proper statistical reporting number(s) for the subheadings enumerated below, the importer shall combine the applicable 8-digit subheading number with the applicable statistical suffix found below.

Any article which is described in any provision in this chapter is classifiable in said provision if the conditions and requirements thereof and of any applicable regulations are met.

2. In the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, the tariff status of an article is not affected by the fact that it was previously imported into the customs territory of the United States and cleared through customs whether or not duty was paid upon such previous importation.

3. Any article exempted under subchapters IV through VII, inclusive, or subchapter IX from the payment of duty shall be exempt also from the payment of any internal-revenue tax imposed upon or by reason of importation.

### Statistical Notes

1. Statistical data are not to be furnished with respect to articles classified in those headings of this chapter for which no statistical suffix is shown.
2. For articles provided for in this chapter, the rate of duty for which is derived from a provision elsewhere in the tariff schedule, the citation to be used in statistical reporting shall be the 10-digit statistical reporting number provided in this chapter followed by the reporting number of the provision from which such rate is derived. The unit of quantity reported hereunder for such articles shall be the same as the unit of quantity for the provision from which the rate was derived. For example, 10 new fully automatic arc welding machines exported for repairs or alterations pursuant to a warranty and returned to the United States the statistical reporting number shall be 9802.00.4040-8515.31.0000, with the quantity being shown as 10 and the value as dutiable value.

   (b) No appraisement of the imported article in its changed condition shall be required unless necessary to a determination of the rate or rates of duty applicable to such article.

   (c) The duty, if any, upon the value of the change in condition shall be at the rate which would apply to the article itself, as an entirety without constructive separation of its components, in its condition as imported if it were not within the purview of this subchapter. If the article, as returned to the United States, is subject to a specific or compound rate of duty, such rate shall be converted to the ad valorem rate which when applied to the full value of such article determined in accordance with said section 402 would provide the same amount of duties as the specific or compound rate.

If the application is made in accordance with the applicable regulations, the Secretary of the Treasury shall promptly forward copies thereof to the Secretary of Commerce and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If, at any time while its application is under consideration by the Secretary of Commerce or by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on appeal from a finding by him, an institution cancels an order for the instrument or apparatus to which its application relates or ceases to have a firm intention to order such instrument or apparatus, it shall promptly so notify the Secretary of Commerce or such Court, as the case may be.

(ii) If the Secretary of Commerce determines that the instrument or apparatus for which application is made is not being manufactured in the United States, the Secretary is authorized to determine further whether any component of such instrument or apparatus of a type that may be purchased, obtained, or imported separately is being manufactured in the United States and shall report the findings to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the applicant institution, and any component found to be domestically available shall remain dutiable.

(iii) Any decision by the Secretary of the Treasury which allows for duty-free entry of a component of an instrument or apparatus which, due to its size cannot be feasibly imported in its assembled state, shall be effective for a specified maximum period, to be determined in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, taking into account both the scientific needs of the importing institution and the potential for development of comparable domestic manufacturing capacity.

(e) Subheading 9810.00.60 shall not apply with respect to any instrument or apparatus unless a bona fide order therefor has been placed, by the institution making the application under this U.S. note, on or before the sixtieth day following the day on which a finding of the Secretary of Commerce favorable to the institution has become final and conclusive.

(f) Within 20 days after the publication in the Federal Register of a finding by the Secretary of Commerce under paragraph (c) of this U.S. note, an appeal may be taken from said finding only upon a question or questions of law and only to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit:

(i) by the institution which made the application under paragraph (b) of this U.S. note;

(ii) by a person who, in the proceeding which led to such finding, represented to the Secretary of Commerce in writing that he manufactures in the United States an instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value for the purposes for which the article to which the application relates is intended to be used,

(iii) by the importer thereof, if the article to which the application relates has been entered at the time the appeal is taken, or

(iv) by an agent of any of the foregoing.

Any appeal under this paragraph shall receive a preference over all other matters before the Court and shall be heard and determined as expeditiously as the Court considers to be practicable. The judgement of the Court shall be final.

(g) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce may prescribe joint regulations to carry out their functions under this note.

For purposes of determining the quantity of square meter equivalents (SME) to be charged against the overall limit, the conversion factors listed in _Correlation: U.S. Textile and Apparel Category System with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States of America 2003_, U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Textiles and Apparel, or successor publication, shall apply.

(b) Subject to the sublimits set out below and the exclusion provided in subdivision (c) of this note, the overall limit in the first calendar year that goods qualify for entry under this provision shall not exceed 100,000,000 SME. If this provision enters into force after January 1 of that year, the overall limit and sublimits shall be reduced in proportion to the number of full months of that year that have expired. Subject to the sublimits set out below, the overall limit for each successive calendar year that the Agreement as specified in general note 29(a) is in effect may increase up to a maximum of 200,000,000 SME in any calendar year, and the sublimits may increase so that they represent the same proportion of the overall limit as in the first calendar year that goods qualify for entry under this provision. Each percentage increase of the limits shall correspond to the percentage increase in imports into the territory of the United States from the other parties to the Agreement as defined in general note 29(a), other than Dominican Republic, of originating goods of chapter 62 of the tariff schedule.

The USTR may likewise modify, in a notice published in the Federal Register, such overall limit and sublimits to reflect CITA determinations to implement decisions of the parties to the Agreement, as defined in general note 29(a) to the tariff schedule, to take into account the ability of the Dominican Republic to participate in such limits.

22. For a textile or apparel good provided for in chapters 61 through 63 of the tariff schedule that is not an originating good under general note 29 and for which the duty treatment set forth in heading 9822.05.10 is claimed, the rate of duty set forth in the general subcolumn of rate of duty column 1 shall apply only on the value of the assembled good minus the value of fabrics formed in the United States, components knit-to-shape in the United States and any other materials of U.S. origin used in the production of such a good, provided that the good is sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of a party to the Agreement (other than the United States) specified in general note 29(a) with thread wholly formed in the United States, from fabrics wholly formed in the United States and cut in one or more parties to the Agreement (other than the United States) as defined in general note 29(a) or from components knit-to-shape in the United States, or both. For purposes of this note--

(a) a fabric is wholly formed in the United States if all the production processes and finishing operations, starting with the weaving, knitting, needling, tufting, felting, entangling or other process, and ending with a fabric ready for cutting or assembly without further processing, took place in the United States; and

(b) a thread is wholly formed in the United States if all the production processes, starting with the extrusion of filaments, strips, film or sheet, and including slitting a film or sheet into strip, or the spinning of all fibers into thread, or both, and ending with thread, took place in the United States.

23. For purposes of this subchapter, the term "goods described in U.S. note 23 to this subchapter" means goods entered under subheading 9822.05.15 or 9822.05.20. Such goods must satisfy the requirements of general note 29(a) to the tariff schedule, except that operations performed in, or material obtained from, the United States shall be considered as if the operations were performed in, and the material was obtained from, a country that is not a party to the Agreement as defined in general note 29(a) to the tariff schedule. For purposes of determining which country-specific tariff-rate quota applies to such a good, the nonpreferential rules of origin used in the normal course of trade shall be applied.

24. The aggregate quantity of goods of Costa Rica described in U.S. note 23 to this subchapter that may be entered under subheading 9822.05.15 in calendar year 2009 or in any subsequent calendar year shall not exceed 2,000 metric tons.

25.
(a) During the periods specified below, the aggregate quantity of goods described in U.S. note 23 to this subchapter of each party to the Agreement as defined in general note 29(a) that may be entered under subheading 9822.05.20 shall be limited to the aggregate quantity (set forth in metric tons) specified below for the country listed:

(b)
(i) Beginning in 2007 and in successive years thereafter, the Office of the United States Trade Representative shall publish in the Federal Register a determination for that calendar year, using the most recent annual data available, of the amount of the trade surplus (the amount by which a country's exports to all destinations exceeds its imports from all sources), by volume, of each party to the Agreement as defined in general note 29(a) to the tariff schedule for goods classified in the following subheadings:

1701.12, 1701.13, 1701.14, 1701.91, 1701.99, 1702.40 and 1702.60,

The quantities of goods of subheadings 1701.12.50, 1701.13.50, 1701.14.50, 1701.91.30, 1701.99.50, 1702.90.20 and 2106.90.46 that are entered under subheading 9822.05.20 shall be determined on a raw-value equivalent basis. For purposes of this note, the term "raw value" means the equivalent of such articles in terms of ordinary commercial raw sugar testing 96 degrees by the polaroscope as determined in accordance with regulations or instructions issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations or instructions may, among other things, provide: (i) for the entry of such articles pending a final determination of polarity; and (ii) that positive or negative adjustments for differences in preliminary and final raw values be made in the same or succeeding quota periods. The principal grades and types of sugar shall be translated into terms of raw value in the following manner--

(A) For articles described in subheadings 1701.12.50, 1701.13.50, 1701.14.50, 1701.91.30, 1701.99.50 and 2106.90.46 by multiplying the number of kilograms thereof by the greater of 0.93, or 1.07 less 0.0175 for each degree of polarization under 100 degrees (and fractions of a degree in proportion).

(B) For articles described in subheading 1702.90.20, by multiplying the number of kilograms of the total sugars thereof (the sum of the sucrose and reducing or invert sugars) by 1.07.

26. The tariff treatment provided for in heading 9822.05.25 is limited to goods that have been mutually agreed by a party to the Agreement as defined in general note 29(a) and by CITA to fall within the following:

(a) hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry;
(b) hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-loomed fabrics; or
(c) traditional folklore handicraft goods.

Such goods must be certified as eligible products of such party by the competent authority of such party, in accordance with any requirements established by CITA.

27. Earned import allowance program.

(a) For purposes of heading 9822.06.05, eligible apparel articles wholly assembled in and imported directly from the Dominican Republic shall enter the United States free of duty, without regard to the source of the fabric or yarns from which the articles are made, if such apparel articles are accompanied by an earned import allowance certificate that reflect the amount of credits equal to the total square meter equivalents (SMEs) of fabric in such apparel articles, in accordance with the earned import allowance program established by the Secretary of Commerce. For purposes of determining the quantity of SMEs under this note, the conversion factors listed in "Correlation: U.S. Textile and Apparel Industry Category System with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States of America, 2008" or its successor publications, of the United States Department of Commerce shall apply.

(b) For purposes of subdivision (a) of this note, the term "eligible apparel articles" means the following articles classified in chapter 62 of the tariff schedule (and meeting the requirements of the rules relating to chapter 62 of the tariff schedule contained in general note 29(n) of such schedule) of cotton (but not of denim): trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches and shorts, skirts and divided skirts and pants.

28.
(a) For purposes of this subchapter, notwithstanding any other provisions of the tariff schedule, the term "goods of Peru, under the terms of general note 32 to the tariff schedule" means goods of Peru that satisfy the requirements of general note 32 to the tariff schedule, except that operations performed in, or material obtained from, the United States shall be considered as if the operations were performed in, and the material was obtained from, a country that is not a party to the Agreement as defined in general note 32 to the tariff schedule.

(b) The United States Trade Representative (USTR) may promulgate regulations to provide for the entry of goods of Peru under subheading 9822.06.10. Such USTR regulations may, among other things, provide for the issuance of certificates of eligibility to accompany goods of Peru imported under such subheading.

(c) Beginning in 2009 and in successive years thereafter, the Office of the United States Trade Representative shall publish in the Federal Register a determination for that calendar year, using the most recent annual data available, of the amount of the trade surplus (the amount by which Peru's exports to all destinations exceeds its imports from all sources), by volume, for goods of Peru under the terms of general note 32 to the tariff schedule, that are classified in the following subheadings:

1701.12, 1701.13, 1701.14, 1701.91, 1701.99, 1702.40 and 1702.60,

except that Peru's exports to the United States of goods classified under subheadings 1701.12, 1701.13, 1701.14, 1701.12, 1701.91 and 1701.99 and its imports of originating goods of the United States classified under subheadings 1702.40 and 1702.60 shall not be included in the calculation of Peru's trade surplus.

(d) The aggregate quantity of goods of Peru under the terms of general note 32 to the tariff schedule that may be entered under subheading 9822.06.10 in any calendar year set forth herein shall be the quantity of goods equal to the lesser of the amount of Peru's trade surplus determined under subdivision (c) of this note or the aggregate quantity of goods specified below for Peru for that year.
